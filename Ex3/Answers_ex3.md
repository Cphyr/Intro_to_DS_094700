# Part B

## Question 1

Yes, if and only if each cluster contains no more the 1 different point.

## Question 2

### 2.1

The search engine will be get an accuracy of 1, if and only if, given *q*, every document in $C$ will be labeled as 0.

### 2.2

Let $C_q = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n] | s.t. x_i\in \{0,1\}$



The true positives are defined as the amount of labeled relevant files that are actually relevant. 

$\because$ We label all files as non-relevant, TP and FP will always be equal to zero, but the FN isnâ€™t always zero.
$$
Recall=\frac{TP}{TP+FN}=\frac{0}{0+\text{Non-Zero}}=0\\
Precision=\frac{TP}{TP+FP}=\frac{0}{0+0}:=1
$$


$\therefore$ Recall = 0, Precision = 1 (by definition).
